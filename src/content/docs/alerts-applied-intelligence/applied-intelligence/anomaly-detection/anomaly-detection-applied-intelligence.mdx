With applied intelligence's anomaly detection, New Relic alerts your team of any unusual behavior instantly. New Relic uses applied intelligence to constantly observe your applications. We use this information to determine your application's baseline, or expected, performance. Whenever behavior deviates from the baseline, we know right away and alert your team so you can address any errors promptly and efficiently.

## How we use anomalies [#anomalies-in-use]

At New Relic, our own developers know how important it is to monitor the health of our applications. We want our customers to access to the data they need whenever they need it so our team needs to be alerted if there are any outliers in our system's performance. New Relic's anomaly detection uses applied intelligence to monitor three key golden signals: throughput, error rate and latency. With anomaly detection, our developers monitor the baseline performance for these metrics.

So, let's say that one afternoon there's a spike in response time and it's taking longer than usual for our customers to access the homepage. Anomaly detection will flag this anomalous behavior because our latency metric data has deviated from its baseline. This doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem, it just indicates that AI has registered something out of the ordinary in our system and we should take a deeper look.

We monitor this unusual behavior in a few ways. First, our team uses the anomaly dashboard so we can see what changed and when.

<figcaption>Explore any anomaly in your system's performance to better understand what errors you're receiving and why.  
  </figcaption>

We also set up notifications for anomalies to be delivered in Slack, and we set up a webhook to deliver messages when we need them.

<figcaption> How to set up slack or webhook notifications for anomalies in the New Relic UI.  
  </figcaption>

These events are also available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After we set up an anomaly detection configuration (a group of apps we're interested in), we can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via incident intelligence.

## There are two types of anomaly detection: automatic and custom

[Automatic anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence#automatic-anomalies) are the most efficient way for your team to learn about unusual behavior in your APM-monitored applications. Automatic anomaly detection is a hands-off tool your team can implement to ensure that you're notified the moment behavior in your application deviates from baseline. You can use automatic anomalies to identify the source of the problem and take the appropriate steps to get your system running smoothly again.

[Custom anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence#custom-anomalies) allow increased configurability for your team. Custom anomalies provide your team with the capability to alert on any NQRL condition and to adjust and optimize your thresholds. Custom anomalies also use the same advanced tuning settings as static alerting so you can ensure your team sees only the anomaly incidents important to you.

## Automatic Anomalies [#automatic-anomalies]

Automatic anomaly detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data:

1. Anomaly detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors.
2. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags the behavior and tracks recovery to normal behavior.
3. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data.

**Automatically on**: By default, anomaly detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the applied intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL.

**Correlation**: Anomalies are connected to our correlation logic, otherwise known as decisions. If our correlation logic determines that issues are connected, then a single issue will be created from multiple incidents. You can see this correlated issue in the issues feed. Anomalies provide additional context about what changed around the time an issue occurred so your team can easily detect patterns and diagnose problems. 

**Receiving notifications:** When New Relic detects anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time, your team has the option to receive notifications about this behavior. We recommend sending notifications selected Slack channels or email channels. When the anomaly goes back to normal then a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications you can still access to the data using a [NRQL query](#anomaly-events).

**Anomaly analysis:** For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and anomaly detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly.

**Activity stream:** Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly.

Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections.

### Requirements [#requirements]

To use New Relic's anomaly detection, ensure you have:

* An APM agent installed for at least one application.
* To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in [your Slack workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/202035138-Add-an-app-to-your-workspace).

For more on data limits, see [Data limits](#data-limits).

### Set up notifications for anomaly detection [#set-up]

Automatic anomaly detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for incident intelligence, you will need to create a anomaly detection configuration. 

You can create a configuration in the anomaly detection UI:

1. From **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, click **Alerts & AI**.
2. Under **Anomaly detection**, click **Settings**.
3. Click **Add a configuration**.
4. Input the following information into the form:

   * Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account.
   * Select an account.
   * Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for anomaly detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation.
5. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies.
6. Optional: [connect to incident intelligence](#add-source).

    To use anomaly detection with Slack:

    1. Select **Slack**.
    2. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the applied intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first.
       <Callout variant="tip">If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been [added to your Slack workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/202035138-Add-an-app-to-your-workspace).</Callout>
    3. Save the configuration.

       You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table.

  To reduce noise, we recommend sending anomalies to a low priority notification channel such as Slack or email.
  </Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

### Mute notifications (Slack only) [#mute-notifications]

In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted.

To mute in Slack, select **Mute this app's warnings** or **Mute all warnings**, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed.

Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Anomaly detection**, and select the configuration to edit.

Muting anomaly detection notifications does not affect alerts.

### Use anomaly detection Slack messages [#feedback]

Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue:

* The application name and a link to more information about it in the New Relic UI .
* The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in the New Relic UI.
* A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly's behavior and degree.
* An **Analyze** button that navigates to an analysis page in applied intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals.

Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select **Yes** or **No**.

### Anomalies tab [#anomaly-overview]

In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the [anomalies Feed](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page#anomalies) on the [alerts and applied intelligence overview page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page). That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis.


### Issue feed [#issue-overview]

In addition to viewing anomalies in the anomalies feed, anomalies are correlated to other incidents and grouped into issues. Anomalies provide context to what has changed around a critical issue. Out of the box anomalies will be correlated with incidents of the same entity type. Correlates unique to your use case can be added using [decisions](/docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/)


### Anomaly visibility settings [#visibility-settings]

Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the applied intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed).

To find these settings: from **Alerts & AI**, under **Anomaly detection**, click **Settings**.

Notes on using these settings:

* These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization.
* Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for [NRQL querying](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).

Details on these UI sections:

* **AI overview and anomalies tab**: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well.
* **Global activity stream**: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout.
* **Anomaly types**: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example, uncheck **Web throughput** and **Non-web throughput** anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.)

### Query anomaly data [#anomaly-events]

You can use [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language) to query and chart your anomaly detection data using the `NrAiAnomaly` event. For example:

`FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT *`

<Callout variant="important">
  This data has previously been attached to the `ProactiveDetection` event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use `ProactiveDetection` in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using `NrAiAnomaly`.
</Callout>

Here are important attributes attached to this event:

### Add anomalies as source in incident intelligence [#add-source]

By integrating incident intelligence with your anomaly detection, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in incident intelligence, see [Configure sources](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#1-configure-sources).

You can also select **Connect to incident intelligence** from inside of a configuration.

### Webhook payload and examples [#webhook]

Automatic anomaly detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure automatic anomaly detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema.

### Data limits

In addition to [requirements](#requirements), data limits include:

* Monitored APM applications: limited to 1,000 per configuration
* Slack configurations: limited to 200 per account
* Webhook configurations: limited to 200 per account
* Configurations without notifications: limited to 200 per account

## Custom anomalies [#custom-anomalies]

First you must create a condition. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Policies > (create or select policy) > Create alert condition**: You can select APM, Browser, or NRQL condition. 

You must then choose anomaly as your alert condition threshold Type.

This threshold will predict the future behavior for the value of your data. . This prediction  appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the anomaly condition UI.

### Configure anomaly thresholds

After you select 'anomaly' for threshold type, you'll need to set your threshold. This will set the criteria that you want to be notified on. 

To do this you'll need to:
* Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both.
* Set the behavior that will trigger an incident (for example: "deviating for more than five minutes") 
* Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source by adjusting the sliding bar to more violations or fewer violations. This bar calculates how many standard deviations away from the prediction  you want to be notified.

<img
  title="Custom anomaly configuration"
  alt="A screenshot demonstrating how to configure custom anomalies"
  src={alertsConfigureYourAnomalyThresholds}
/>

When your data escapes the predicted "normal" behavior and meets the criteria you've chosen, you'll receive a notification.

Here are some tips for setting anomaly thresholds:

* Set the [anomaly direction](#upper-lower) to monitor violations that happen either above or below the anomaly.
* Set the preview chart to either [2 days or 7 days](#days) of displayed data. (Not applicable for [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries).)
* Use the slider bar to adjust the <img title="Alerts v3: Critical alert icon" alt="icon-alert-critical.png" src={iconAlertCritical}/> **Critical** threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the anomaly. The tighter the band around the anomaly, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate.
* Optional: You can create a <img title="Alerts v3: Warning alert icon" alt="icon-alert-warning.png" src={iconAlertWarning}/> [**Warning** threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/set-thresholds-alert-condition#threshold-levels) (the darker gray area around the anomaly).
* For NRQL alerts, see the [allowed types of NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries#threshold-types).
* If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.)

### Faceted anomaly conditions [#anomaly-facets]

Once you've run a faceted NRQL query for a anomaly condition, you can scope your results to a single anomaly.

<img
  title="Faceted anomalies"
  alt="A screenshot depicting faceted anomalies"
  src={alertsFacetedAnomalies}
/>

The single time series shows the anomaly, threshold band, and one or more violation regions, if there are any.

  alt="A screenshot depicting a deeper dive into facted anomalies "
  src={alertsFacetedAnomaliesTwo}
/>

### Anomaly direction: select upper or lower ranges

You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the predicted value ("upper") or that goes below the predicted value ("lower"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the  prediction direction selector.

Example use cases for this:
* You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down.
* You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem.

Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different anomaly direction settings. The red areas represent violations

### Rules governing calculation of the predicted value

The algorithm for calculating the prediction is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities:

* **Age of data** On initial creation, the  prediction is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and  prediction type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the  predicted value will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the  prediction and thresholds will become.
* **Consistency of data** For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the  prediction. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds.
* **Regular fluctuations** For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the  prediction algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them.
