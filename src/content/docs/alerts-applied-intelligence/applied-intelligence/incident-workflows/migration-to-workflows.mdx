title: Notification migration 
metaDescription: Migrating notifications from alerts and applied intelligence 
redirects: 
---
The classic notification system for alerts and applied intelligence is being replaced by workflows. This is good news because workflows is an improved, flexible notification system. Workflows help your team learn about potential errors within the greater context of your stack so you can take immediate and efficient action.

What does [this migration](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/plan-to-upgrade-alert-notification-channels-to-workflows-and-destinations/188205) mean for your team? In our previous notification model, your team would create an alert condition with different thresholds and parameters. If that condition was associated with a specific policy, was violated, and you wanted your team to know about it right away, you would add **notification settings**. Our notification settings would tell New Relic what data to send where.  

Now, we've added workflows. Going forward, instead of configuring classic notification channels and associating them to policies, notification destinations will be created and associated to workflows. Workflows can process data from a range of policies and can use attributes like tags or priority to organize notifications.

## What to expect [#what-to-expect]

The migration from the classic notification system to workflows creates a **destination** for each **classic notification channel** and connects them to **workflows** created for each **policy.** Only policies with channel associations will be migrated.

1. New Relic will automatically migrate accounts from January 9-31 2023.
2. New Relic can migrate accounts earlier, just reach out to your account team.
3. Your team can avoid the automated migration by removing channels from policies.

## Known changes [#known-changes]

Notifications will not substantially change during the migration.  They will continue to have the same attribute names and most of the same values.  The migration to workflows will change the following:

* All _url attribute values will change and lead to issue based pages, not incident based pages.
condition_id will now always have the same value as condition_family_id.
* issue_id has been added. Consumers should switch all integrations to using the issue_id instead of the incident_id, as the incident_id may be removed at some point.
* radar_entity.entityGuid and targets[0].id will be an entity guid when one is available for all types except for Webhooks.
* targets[0].labels will contain all tags from the issue, not just the tags for the entity defined by the target.
* targets[0].link and violation_callback_url will lead to the issue page.
* open_violations_count.critical will contain the count of all open incidents across all priorities. Priority specific counts are unavailable.
* open_violations_count.warning will always be 0. Priority specific counts are unavailable.
* closed_violations_count.critical will contain the count of all closed incidents across all priorities. Priority specific counts are unavailable.
* closed_violations_count.warning will always be 0. Priority specific counts are unavailable.
* owner will have a value of NA if the issue has not been acknowledged

## Configuring custom payloads [#configure-custom-payloads]

When moving from notification channels to workflows your team may want to make some tweaks to your custom payloads. Workflows still function in the same way as notifications in that, when a condition is violated then a notification is sent to a webhook and when it is sent, it goes with its custom payload. The migration from notification channels to workflows requires changing some of the terminology in this payload.

The following table provides a translation between what the webhook payload names used in our classic notification system and their new, corresponding names in the issue payload.  

For many keys, the issue payload may contain a list of values.
