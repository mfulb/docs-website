The Model Performance monitoring solution of New Relic provides a Python library that makes it easy to monitor your ML models.
With **bring your own data (BYOD)**, you can quickly send your model's inference and metric data to the New Relic platform, directly from a notebook or any other environment.

The key features:
 * Easy to integrate
 * ML framework agnostic
 * Full compatibility with New Relic observability framework
 * Based on the `newrelic-telemetry-sdk-python` library
 * Monitoring and alerting:
    * Predictions
    * Features
    * Missing values
    * Model and Data drift
    * Custom inference data
    * Custom performance metrics

The [`ml-performance-monitoring`](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring) python package, based on [`newrelic-telemetry-sdk-python`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-python), allows you to send your model's features and prediction values, as well as custom metrics, by simply adding a few lines to your code.

Use the python package to send the following types of data to New Relic:

1. **Inference data:** Stream your model's feature and prediction values. 
Inference data is streamed as a **[custom event](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api/)** named `InferenceData`.

2. **Data metrics:** Instead of sending all your raw inference data, select the aggregated statistics option over the features, and predictions (for example, `min`, `max`, `average`, or `percentile`). They will be sent automatically as **[metrics](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/introduction-metric-api/)**.

3. **Custom metrics:** Calculate your own metrics, monitor your model performance or model data, and stream them to New Relic using the `record_metrics` function. They are sent as **[metrics](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/metric-api/introduction-metric-api/)**.
