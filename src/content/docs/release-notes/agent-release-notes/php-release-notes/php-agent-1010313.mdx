### New features ###
* APM logs in context support for Monolog 2 and 3

  The PHP agent will now generate logging metrics for Monolog (versions 2 and 3) to allow seeing the rate of log messages by severity. 
  These metrics are enabled by default and are controlled by a config file directive.
  The PHP agent can also now forward log messages from Monolog for viewing on the New Relic One platform.  
  Log forwarding is currently disabled by default (can be enabled by a config file directive), and will be enabled by default in a future release.

  To learn more about APM logs in context see the [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context).

  For more information about logs in context and the PHP agent check the following [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-php/).
