## Impact of automatic logging [#background]

By default, New Relic APM agents automatically forward log data. You can manage this feature at the account level:

* To comply with your organization's policy.
* For security and compliance reasons, we want to control which logs are forwarded.
* When there are severe cost constraints and you do not want to increase TDP usage.
* The design of system resources doesn't allow for the increased overhead of the logs transfer function.

Automatic logs collection is not applicable if your agent has [high security mode](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/high-security-mode/) enabled.

## Agents which automatically forward logs [#versions]

* Go [v3.18.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes)
* Java [v7.6.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes/)
* .NET [v9.7.0.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes/)
* Node.js [v8.11.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes)
* PHP [v10.1.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes)
* Python [v7.12.0.176](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes)
* Ruby [v8.6.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/)

## Options to manage automatic logging settings [#solution]

You can disable (or re-enable) automatic log forwarding across your entire account via the APM log settings UI or the API. You can also enable or disable log collection for specific agents via agent configuration.

    The APM log settings UI allows you to manage whether APM log forwarding is enabled or disabled at the parent and child account level.

    #### Parent account settings

    At the parent account level, you can choose to enable or disable APM log forwarding. Any child accounts that have not made their own changes from the default setting (enabled) will automatically inherit any changes made from the parent account. Child accounts that have applied their own changes will **not** be affected by parent account changes. 

    Parent accounts can also choose to lock or unlock APM log forwarding settings. Locking forces all child accounts to inherit the parent account's enabled or disabled setting, regardless of whether they had previously updated their own enabled or disabled setting. Unlocking allows child accounts to override the parent account's enabled or disabled setting.

    #### Child account settings

    At the child account level, you can enable or disable APM log forwarding as long as the parent account has not locked this setting. When the parent account locks APM log forwarding, a child account will inherit the parent account's enabled or disabled setting and be unable to make any changes.

    />

    1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) in the New Relic UI, click **Manage your data > Log settings**.
    2. Click the ellipsis **...** menu at the right side of the account's row.
    3. Click the confirmation button to enable or disable and lock or unlock automatic logging (parent accounts) or enable or disable only (child accounts).

    After you disable via the New Relic UI, it may take several minutes for the agent to restart and stop automatic log forwarding.

    Use the `dataManagementUpdateFeatureSettings` in [**api.newrelic.com/graphiql**](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Refer to the populated example and related documentation in the GraphiQL UI.

    When you disable or enable via the NerdGraph API, changes should take effect immediately. 

    **Query example:**

    ```graphql
    {
      actor {
        account(id: <ACCOUNT_ID_HERE>) {
          dataManagement {
            featureSettings {
              enabled
              key
              name
              locked
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Mutation example:**

    Use this mutation to update each account individually.

    ```graphql
    mutation {
      dataManagementUpdateFeatureSettings(
        accountId: <ACCOUNT_ID_HERE>
        setting: {
          enabled: false
          locked: true
          featureSetting: { 
            key: "apm_log_forwarding" 
          }
        }
      ) {
        enabled
        key
        name
        locked
      }
    }
    ```

    If you want to disable automatic log forwarding for some agents and enable it for others, you can adjust each agent's client-side configuration settings. The agents will never instrument the log data in the first place; instead, they will completely remove the logs. You will need to use client-side configuration if you need to lower overhead.

    Client-side configuration settings work completely independently of server-side configuration. The config setting to disable auto logging takes precedence even if the server-side configuration takes precedence for the agent (like Ruby) in other situations. Only the agents that read the changed config file will be impacted.

    For more information, see the procedures for the specific agent:

    * [Go](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-go)
    * [Java](/docs/logs/logs-context/java-configure-logs-context-all/#1-agent)
    * [.NET](/docs/logs/logs-context/net-configure-logs-context-all/#1-agent)
    * [Node.js](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-nodejs/#1-agent)
    * [PHP](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-php/#1-agent)
    * [Python](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-python/#1-agent)
    * [Ruby](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-ruby/#1-agent)

## Frequently asked questions [#FAQs]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="disable-before-install"
    title="Can I turn off logs from agents prior to installing any language agents?"
  >
    Yes. Use the [UI](#disable-ui) or [API](#manage-api) to accomplish this.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="install-after-disable"
    title="What happens if more agents are added after making this change?"
  >
    When automatic log forwarding is disabled via API or UI, all APM language agents that can send logs by default will have logging turned off going forward for that account.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="overhead-impact"
    title="What impact does this have on client overhead?"
  >
    Turning off APM logs means no log data will be forwarded; all other aspects of log inspection remain the same. To completely disable all logging related activity in the agent, change the agent's [client-side configuration](#disable-config) to disable logs.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="billing-impact"
    title="How does my billable ingested data change by disabling automatic log forwarding?"
  >
    There will be no change in APM data ingest, but log data ingest will drop. For more information about managing your data in New Relic, see our [data ingest documentation](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).
